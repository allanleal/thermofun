/// Issues ///

-In the AD model the derivatives with T and P (RHO)? of the thermodynamic porperties are not correctly clauclated inside the ThermoScalar
probably because of the implementation 

-aqueous speices porperties using supcrt implementation does not calculate correct implicit derivatives of the themro prop with T and P?

-For Psat or P = 0 in the case of minerals and other substances for which the calculaitons are independent of H2Oaq, P remains 0 since we need the function from the water proeprties to calculate the Psat.

-for minerals A and U are not calculated

-------

- the calculation of the derivatives with T and P for the ThermoScalar types is not correclty implemented inside the Gfuntion of 
  HKFgems model
- if(ps.density > 1000.0 || ps.density < 350.0) g = 0, not used in HKFgems implementation

- what to do when T-P exeeds the model/parameter limits
- what do do when a given substance is not in the internal data structure 

------

- In GEMS RTparam G0 in not backcorrected for the fluid mixtures models. The correction is made when calculating equilibirum and when exporting GEMS files.
- fluids subroutines in GEMS and TCorrPT only implemented for CO2 and H2O (TCorrPT checks the formula)
