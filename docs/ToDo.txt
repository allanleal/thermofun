/// Issues ///

-In the AD model the derivatives with T and P (RHO)? of the thermodynamic porperties are not correctly clauclated inside the ThermoScalar
probably because of the implementation 

-aqueous speices porperties using supcrt implementation does not calculate correct implicit derivatives of the themro prop with T and P?

-Psat or P = 0 in the case of minerals remains 0 since we need the function from the water proeprties to calculate the Psat.

-for minerals A and U are not calculated
